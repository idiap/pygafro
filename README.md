# Geometric Algebra For RObotics in Python

This library provides a geometric algebra tools targeted towards robotics applications.
It includes various computations for the kinematics and dynamics of serial manipulators
as well as optimal control.

It is based on *gafro*, a C++ library relying on templates to efficiently implement the
geometric algebra operations.

Please visit https://gitlab.com/gafro in order to find the entire *gafro* software stack.

## Installation using pip

	pip install pygafro

## Installation from source

(works either in a conda or virtual environment)

**Note:** Tests are run automatically after the compilation, and requires ```numpy``` to be installed.

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	make install

## Usage

### Multivectors

	from pygafro import Multivector
	from pygafro import Point
	from pygafro import Motor

	# create a multivector that corresponds to a Euclidean vector
	vector = Multivector.create(['e1', 'e2', 'e3'], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

	# create a point (a specialized multivector subclass)
	point = Point(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)

	# create a random motor
	motor = Motor.Random()

	# apply the motor to our multivectors
	vector2 = motor.apply(vector)
	point2 = motor.apply(point)

	# geometric product
	result = vector * point

	# inner product
	result = vector | point

	# outer product
	result = vector ^ point

### Robots

	from pygafro import FrankaEmikaRobot

	panda = FrankaEmikaRobot()

	position = panda.getRandomConfiguration()

	# forward kinematics: compute the motor at the end-effector
	ee_motor = panda.getEEMotor(position)

## Differences between *gafro* and *pygafro*

*gafro* being based on C++ templates, only the classes and operations you are effectively
using are compiled into your software.

This versatility cannot be achieved in a Python library: we cannot instantiate the
templates at runtime, nor can we realistically instantiate all the possible combinations
at compile time.

A compromise was choosen: a subset of multivectors (using sensible blades combinations)
are instantiated and compiled, and other blades combinations are supported through a
Python class that internally use a C++ multivector with more blades and transparently
use a mask to only expose the blades requested by the user.

Thus, creating a multivector is done using the following helper function:

	# using values
	vector = Multivector.create(['e1', 'e2', 'e3'], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

	# using only the list of blades
	vector = Multivector.create(['e1', 'e2', 'e3', 'ei', 'e123i'])
