# Assets package for pygafro (Geometric Algebra For RObotics in Python)

Contains mesh and texture files for the robots available in [pygafro](https://github.com/idiap/pygafro/).

**This package is optional and isn't needed if you don't want to display the robots!**
Note that *pygafro* doesn't provide any rendering functions, it only indicates which mesh file
to use for each link.

## Installation using pip

	pip install pygafro-assets

## Background
